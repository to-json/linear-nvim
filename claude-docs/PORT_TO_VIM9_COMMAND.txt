Port the Neovim Lua plugin at /Users/jaesaxon/hc/linear-cli/linear.lua to vim9script and save it as /Users/jaesaxon/hc/linear-cli/linear.vim

Requirements:
- Use blocking operations (system() instead of jobstart)
- Replace vim.ui.select() with numbered menus using input()
- Replace vim.ui.input() with input()
- Replace vim.notify() with echo/echoerr
- Use json_decode() for JSON parsing
- Keep all the same functionality: view issue, comment, create, take, assign, export, etc.
- Keep context-aware issue ID resolution (explicit arg -> buffer var -> issue map -> prompt)
- Keep the skip_buffer parameter for ViewIssue
- Keep all buffer editing features (acwrite buffers for issues/comments/create)
- Keep autocmds for saving changes
- Register all the same commands

The user is okay with blocking operations and simpler UI - they just want it to work in regular Vim (not just Neovim).

Make sure to:
1. Read the full linear.lua file to understand all functions
2. Port each function to vim9script syntax
3. Test that the vim9script syntax is correct
4. Create the linear.vim file with complete functionality

NOTE: A partial vim9script version has already been created at linear.vim but needs validation/completion.
